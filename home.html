        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in West Michigan. I haven't left Michigan because I love the changing seasons and variety of outdoor activities.

        <h2>Journey to coding</h2>
        <p>
            I started a coding botcamp in 2023, but I first learned html in 2008, and SQL in 2022. I have been
            interested in technology for many years, leading me to be the point person on the database in my department
            (and to have other departments ask me about their setup). Coworkers regularly ask me questions, and I've
            been jokingly called an unofficial member of the IT office. Now I'm in a C# .NET bootcamp to move into a tech job where I can use my experience with end users to build apps they will find useable.

        <h2>When I'm not coding...</h2>
        <p>I enjoy outdoor things like cycling and hiking. I also enjoy indoor things like food (cooking, baking, canning), music (piano and percussion) and propagating succulents.
